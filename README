epub2mobi.py

Very simple script that looks for .epub files in a directory tree
(by default starting in the current one, but you can specify it
as the first argument in the command line), converts them to
.mobi, and store them in the flat directory specified as the
second argument in the command line, or 'kindle' by default.  It
ignores files whose path includes any string present in the list
ignore_if (currently not accessible from the command line).

Requires ebook-convert, coming from calibre
(http://calibre-ebook.com).  Go to Preferences, select
Miscellaneous in Advanced, and click the "Install command line
tools" button.
